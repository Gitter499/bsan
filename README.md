BorrowSanitizer is work-in-progress LLVM instrumentation pass for detecting aliasing violations in multi-language Rust applications. Our project is still in early stages, and it is not functional yet. Our goal is to support detecting the following types of errors:
* Violations of Rust's [*Tree Borrows*](https://perso.crans.org/vanille/treebor/) aliasing model.
* Accesses out-of-bounds
* Use-after free errors.


## Setup
We only support x86 and ARM Linux. You can build, install, and test BorrowSanitizer using `xb`, our build script. For first-time setup, run:
```
xb setup
```
This will install a [custom Rust toolchain](https://github.com/BorrowSanitizer/rust) under the name `bsan`. You can speed this up by building our [dev container](https://containers.dev/), which already has the `bsan` toolchain installed. We recommend using the container to avoid any environment-specific issues.

You can install BorrowSanitizer with:
```
xb install
```
This will place our binaries into the Cargo [home directory](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/cargo-home.html), which is usually `$HOME/.cargo`. You will need to have `bsan` set as the active toolchain (e.g. `rustup default bsan`) for our tool to work. 

To test a crate using BorrowSanitizer, run:
```
cargo bsan test
```
