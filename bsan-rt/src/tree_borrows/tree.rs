// Ported from Miri (commit:072a9fa) with edits: removed `ProvenanceExtra` & `VisitProvenance`
// - added `EagerTree` and `LazyTree`
// - adapted GC functions for shadow memory reference counter
//! In this file we handle the "Tree" part of Tree Borrows, i.e. all tree
//! traversal functions, optimizations to trim branches, and keeping track of
//! the relative position of the access to each node being updated. This of course
//! also includes the definition of the tree structure.
//!
//! Functions here manipulate permissions but are oblivious to them: as
//! the internals of `Permission` are private, the update process is a black
//! box. All we need to know here are
//! - the fact that updates depend only on the old state, the status of protectors,
//!   and the relative position of the access;
//! - idempotency properties asserted in `perms.rs` (for optimizations)
