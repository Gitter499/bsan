# Shared Components
This library contains components which are shared between the run-time and the front-end instrumentation pass within our fork of the Rust compiler. This includes the permission structure and FSA for Tree Borrows. These components were originally implemented by [contributors to Miri](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/commits/master/src/borrow_tracker) and [the Rust compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commits/master/compiler/rustc_abi/src/lib.rs). We have made modifications to support our use-case.
