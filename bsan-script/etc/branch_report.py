Usage: branch_report.py <output.json> --branch-csv CSV [CSV ...]
                        --main-csv CSV [CSV ...]

Build the dataset behind a per-branch benchmark page from the raw per-test CSVs
`bench.py` writes (target, crate_name, version, test_name, mode, status,
mean_exec_time_seconds): one set measured on the branch, one on `main`.

The page answers one question: did this branch make BorrowSanitizer faster or
slower than `main`? So for each target and each mode it reports per-crate wall
time in seconds for both sides, over a workload both sides completed.

Common tests
    For a given target and mode, a crate's seconds are the SUM of its tests'
    means, restricted to tests that succeeded on BOTH `main` and the branch.
    Without the restriction each side covers whatever it happened to complete,
    so a side that lost tests is credited with less work and looks faster for
    it. Statuses come from the CSV, which records a failure per (test, mode)
    rather than aborting the run.

No calibration
    bench.py measures a test binary directly with an `--exact` filter, so there
    is no per-invocation cargo constant to subtract; every total is a plain sum
    of means.

Everything left out of the common set is reported in `dropped` with its status
on each side, and for each failing side the error bench.py found in its output
and a link to the CI log holding that output, so the page can show which tests
changed behaviour, and why, rather than only how many.

When a CSV is given more than once for the same (target, crate, test, mode),
the last row wins, so fresh `main` results listed after a cached copy replace it.

Earlier runs
    Rerunning a branch adds a line rather than replacing one, so a new commit
    can be compared with the ones before it, and a rerun of the same commit
    shows how far the numbers move between runs. `--previous` is the report
    the branch's page last published; its most recent `--max-runs` runs are
    kept, with their per-test times under `raw`, and every line is summed
    over the tests that succeeded on `main` and in every kept run that
    measured the crate. `dropped` compares only the newest run with `main`.
