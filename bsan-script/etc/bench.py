# environment right before it invokes the actual `miri` binary as an interpreter.
# Then, we create a shell script to recreate that environment and execute `miri`
# directly, bypassing `cargo-miri`.
#
# This happens in two stages. First, we emit the shell script below. This is a one-time
# operation; we reuse it for subsequent invocations. Whenever we execute Miri, we set
# the `MIRI` environment variable to point to this script. Every time that `cargo-miri`
# invokes the `miri` binary, this script will be executed instead. It forwards all
# argument to `miri`, but it also checks to see if it is being invoked as the final call
# to the interpreter. We identify this case if the variable `CARGO_PRIMARY_PACKAGE` is set
# and the flag `--test` is provided. In that situation, we capture the environment and all
# flags, and emit it as an additional shell script. That final shell script, which is
# created per-test, is what gets benchmarked.
