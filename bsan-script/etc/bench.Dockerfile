# with BorrowSanitizer rebuilt and installed from the commit being benchmarked.
#
# Built once per commit and target, so that each of the many per-crate bench
# jobs starts with BorrowSanitizer already installed instead of running
# `./xb install` itself. The source is only mounted for the build, and the build
# and cargo caches are dropped in the same step, so the one layer this adds on
# top of the base holds just what `xb install` changed; the base's layers are
# the ones every job already pulls.
